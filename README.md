### Descriptive Statistics

An exploration of a star dataset used for stellar classification using the Python `pandas` library.

[Sample the Stars](/notebooks/descriptive_stats.ipynb)

### Simple Linear Regression

A small dataset containing salary information of employees at a company is explored in this section using simple linear regression.

I make my initial explorations using `pandas` and then plot a scatter graph and line of best fit using `matplotlib`.

I then create a statistical model using the Object Modelling System (OMS) from `statsmodels`. I test the validity of this stats model using a machine learning module: `sklearn`.

Finally, I use this model to make a prediction on salary based on number of years worked at the company.

### Multiple Linear Regression

### Logistic Regression

### Time Series Decomposition

A breakdown of French stock market data over time, separated into four underlying factors: trends, seasonal, residual and noise.
